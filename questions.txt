If a function return a pointer, can we have it also writing in the pointed
zone ?

  No.

SMECY directive syntax:

  In C/C++:

    #pragma smecy ...

	Use \ at the end of line for continuation information

  In Fortran:

    !$smecy ...

	Use & at the end of line for continuation information

  In other languages: use #pragma equivalent, if not available, use
  comments Ã  la Fortran. For example in Python:

    #$smecy ...

	Use & at the end of line for continuation information

Use if() to predicate hardware launching

If only partial elements of an out argument are written, argument should
be declared inout

arg(arg_number,<attribute_list>) :

  arg_number: order of the argument we specify

  in, out, inout, unused

  [][] declaration size/[][]restriction size

Communication model : use a virtual dash-board view for arrays. Use
geometrical properties or #pragma to avoid communications.
